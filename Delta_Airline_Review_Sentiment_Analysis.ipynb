We had hotel booked in Portugal and a business seminar scheduled for October 15th. All of a sudden our flight was delayed, and then delayed a 2nd time in which Delta offered a $500 voucher to me and my husband. By 3 am we were still in NY and then the flight got cancelled. We lost our hotel in Portugal but still had to pay for it, they booked us a flight in economy to Paris and then to Lisbon on the 14th and by the time we made it to Lisbon we had no bags. Our bags only showed up 3 days later. I filed a claimed and Delta thinks the $500 voucher is compensation enough. I am a yearly paying customer and reconsidering dropping them since that doesn't mean anything to them. Delta is only here to get your money and not caring for anything else. Very disappointed and going to file a second claim.\n"
